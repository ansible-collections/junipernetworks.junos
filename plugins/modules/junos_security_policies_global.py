module: junos_security_policies_global
version_added: 2.9.0
short_description: Manage global security policy settings on Juniper JUNOS devices
description: This module provides declarative management of global security policy settings on Juniper JUNOS devices
author: Pranav Bhatt (@pranav-bhatt)
requirements:
  - ncclient (>=v0.6.4)
  - xmltodict (>=0.12.0)
notes:
- This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the device being managed.
- This module works with connection C(netconf).
- See L(the Junos OS Platform Options,https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_junos.html).

        it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and
        the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the
        value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config)
        option should be the same format as the output of command
        I(show security policies detail) executed on device. For state I(parsed) active
        connection to remote host is not required.
